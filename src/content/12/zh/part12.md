<!-- In this part, we will learn how to package code into standard units of software called containers. These containers can help us develop software faster and easier than before. Along the way, we will also explore a completely new viewpoint for web development outside of the now-familiar Node.js backend and React frontend.-->
在这一部分，我们将学习如何将代码打包成软件标准单元，即容器。这些容器可以帮助我们比以往更快更容易地开发软件。一路上，我们还将探索一种全新的网络开发视角，不再局限于现在熟悉的Node.js后端和React前端。

<!-- We will utilize containers to create immutable execution environments for our Node.js and React projects. Containers also make it easy to include multiple services with our projects. With the flexibility, we will explore and experiment with many different and popular tools by utilizing containers.-->
我们将利用容器为我们的Node.js和React项目创建不可变的执行环境。容器还可以轻松地将多个服务与我们的项目结合起来。利用容器的灵活性，我们将探索和实验许多不同和流行的工具。
